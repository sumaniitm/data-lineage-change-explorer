# algorithms-implementations

This repository aims to produce python code to implement the algorithms listed in the book "Introduction to Algorithms by Cormen, Leiserson Rivest & Stein".

The development will be done with OOP constructs in mind and keeping Orthogonality, Reversibility and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principals in mind.

Stay tuned
