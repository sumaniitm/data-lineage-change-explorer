# algorithms-implementations

The main branch of this repo will hold the base working application which can work standalone to visualize the quality/drift of the domain objects across their lineage, involved in a data pipeline

However, since the core of this work is based on breadth first search of the nodes of a directed graph, it is strongly advised to avoid overlapping edges emanating from & descending on multiple nodes 

This is also needed to allow a clear view of the edge levels showing the percentage difference in the data
